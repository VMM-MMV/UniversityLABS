riverbank publication no  written in  when friedman was must be regarded as the most important single publication incryptology it took the science into a new world entitled the index ofcoincidence and its applications in cryptography it described thesolution of two complicated cipher systems friedman however was lessinterested in proving their vulnerability than he was in using them as avehicle for new methods of cryptanalysisin it friedman devised two new techniques one was brilliant itpermitted him to reconstruct a primary cipher alphabet without havingto guess at a single plaintext letter but the other was profound for thefirst time in cryptology friedman treated a frequency distribution as anentity as a curve whose several points were causally related not as justa collection of individual letters that happen to stand in a certain orderfor noncausal historical reasons and to this curve he applied statisticalconcepts the results can only be described as promethean forfriedmans stroke of genius inspired the numerous varied and vitalstatistical tools that are indispensable to the cryptology of todaybefore friedman cryptology eked out an existence as a study untoitself as an isolated phenomenon neither borrowing from norcontributing to other bodies of knowledge frequency counts linguisticcharacteristics kasiski examinationsall were peculiar and particular tocryptology it dwelt a recluse in the world of science friedman ledcryptology out of this lonely wilderness and into the broad rich domain ofstatistics he connected cryptology to mathematics the sense ofexpanding horizons must have resembled that felt by chemists whenfriedrich wohler synthesized urea demonstrating that life processesoperate under wellknown chemical laws and are therefore subject toexperimentation and control and leading to todays vast strides inbiochemistry when friedman subsumed cryptanalysis under statistics he likewise flung wide the door to anarmamentarium to which cryptology had never before had access itsweaponsmeasures of central tendency and dispersion of fit andskewness of probability and sampling and significancewere ideallyfashioned to deal with the statistical behavior of letters and wordscryptanalysts seizing them with alacrity have wielded them withnotable success ever sincethis is why friedman has said in looking back over his career thatthe index of coincidence was his greatest single creation it alone wouldhave won him his reputation but in fact it was only the beginning he and mrs friedman quit riverbank near the end of  thesituation had become intolerable fabyan had lured him back after thewar with raises and promises of absolute freedom to prove or disprovethe existence of ciphers in shakespeare but he had squelched everyattempt to do so and had embarrassed friedman into apparentlyacquiescent silence at lanternslide lectures on the subject on january  friedman began a sixmonth contract with the signal corps todevise cryptosystems when it expired he was taken on the civilservicepayroll of the war department at  a yearone of his first assignments was to teach a course in military codesand ciphers at the signal school then at camp alfred vail new jerseyfor this he wrote a textbook that for the first time imposed order uponthe chaos of cipher systems and their terminology these had sproutedin a bewildering variety and writers treated each as individual andspecial cases friedman sorted them out on the basis of structureinstead of aspect and so logical and useful was this classification that ithas become standard he modeled his nomenclature on his categories sothat the names he minted have the great merit of making the relationsbetween the various genera of ciphers evident on sight an example is thecomplementary pair monoalphabet and polyalphabet the frenchwere still calling polyalphabetic systems by the almost obfuscatorydouble substitution which tells absolutely nothing at all about thesystem friedmans most important coinage was the wordcryptanalysis which he devised in  to clear up a chronic source ofconfusion in cryptologythe ambiguity of the verb decipher then usedto mean both authorized and unauthorized reductions of a cryptogram to plaintexthe titled his book elements of cryptanalysis and the term has soprospered that today it circulates in general conversation and print
